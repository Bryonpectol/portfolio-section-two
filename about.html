      <p class="aboutp">
        I am a student at Utah Valley University, studying Web Development and
        programming. I am currently a part time worker at the University Mall in
        Orem as a sales associate at Tie One On. I served a mission for the
        Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints in Guayaquil, Ecuador. I
        know how to speak Spanish as a second language. I am working on getting
        my undergraduate in Web Development and after that, I plan to use my
        Bachelor's Degree to start my own online retail company with my brother, <a target = "_blank" class = "brycelink" href= "https://brycesportfolio.netlify.com/">Bryce Pectol</a>. I will then further my
        education in the future when my business has become stable and I will
        work on getting my minor in Business Management.
